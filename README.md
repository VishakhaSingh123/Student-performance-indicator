## 🌐 Overview

This project builds a production-style ML pipeline to predict student math scores based on:
- Gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level
- Lunch type, test preparation course completion
- Reading and writing scores

Rather than training a single model, the system **automatically benchmarks 7 algorithms**, tunes hyperparameters for each, and selects the best performer — then serves predictions via a Flask web interface.

---

## 🏫 Problem Statement

Understanding which factors influence student academic performance can help educators and institutions make better interventions. This project answers:

> *"Given a student's background and other scores, what math score can we predict — and which ML model does it best?"*

## 📊 Model Benchmarking Results

All 7 models trained and evaluated on the same test set with hyperparameter tuning:

| Model | R2 Score |
|---|---|
| **Linear Regression** ← Selected | **0.880** |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.871 |
| CatBoost Regressor | 0.852 |
| Random Forest | 0.853 |
| XGBoost | 0.849 |
| AdaBoost | 0.850 |
| Decision Tree | 0.737 |

> **Best Model: Linear Regression — R2 Score: 0.88**
>
> The model explains **88% of the variance** in student math scores. Linear Regression outperformed all ensemble methods on this dataset, suggesting strong linear relationships between the features and target variable.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
```

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VishakhaSingh123/Student-performance-indicator
cd Student-performance-indicator

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
```bash
python app.py
```

Open browser at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata`

---

## ☁️ Deployment

Deployed on **Render** (Free Tier) using Gunicorn as the WSGI server.

**Live URL:** https://student-performance-indicator-2sy9.onrender.com/predictdata

> ⚠️ Note: Free tier instances spin down after inactivity — first load may take 30-50 seconds to wake up.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- Dataset limited to one school district — may not generalise broadly
- Linear Regression selected as best model — more complex datasets may benefit from ensemble methods
- Free tier deployment spins down with inactivity

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Add more features — attendance, extracurricular activities
- [ ] Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation
- [ ] Add prediction confidence intervals
- [ ] Upgrade to persistent deployment
- [ ] Add data visualisation dashboard

## 🎓 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete ML engineering workflow — from raw data through transformation pipelines, automated model selection, and live deployment. The system achieves an **R2 score of 0.88**, correctly explaining 88% of variance in student math scores, with Linear Regression outperforming 6 other algorithms including XGBoost and CatBoost.
